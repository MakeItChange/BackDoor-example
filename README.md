THE CODE IS GIVEN TO THE PUBLIC FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, I ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ILLICIT USE PF IT.

This example is just a client and a server that communicate. 
The server is able to send command to the client by cmd command line, once you start the server and the client you can manipulate your own PC navigating throught it by cmd command line like:
-cd 
-dir
-mkdir
-cut
Basically you can do everything that you could do with your CMD
